## Introduction
RecycleThis is a mobile game for kids to teach them about recycling.\
The goal of the player is to correctly sort as many items as possible in 1 minute. If you put an item in the wrong bin, you lose points. 

## Tech stack

- React-native-game-engine
- Expo CLI
- AsyncStorage

## Open Source Projects we used
- [react-native-game-engine](https://github.com/bberak/react-native-game-engine)
- [react-native-leaderboard](https://github.com/JoeRoddy/react-native-leaderboard#readme)
- [nativeBase](https://nativebase.io/)
- [Timer credits](https://medium.com/better-programming/building-a-simple-countdown-timer-with-react-4ca32763dda7)

## Project Setup

1. ```npm install ```
2. ```expo start ```
3. Download Expo app on your phone.
4. Scan the QR code
5. Play the game!

You should also be able to run it on an Android/iOS simulator.\

## What I learned

- I worked on the music functionality in the game. Handled the component lifecycle to control when the music should play and when it shouldn’t. Also worked on the mute and unmute feature. I used the open source library react-native-game-engine and the expo-av library for audio.

## Challenges

- Handling the component lifecycle wasn't easy. Took me a while to figure it out

## What's next?

- adding sound effects!
- implementing a global leaderboard rather than local (add database)
- adding a nicer landscape for the game's screen (mountains))
- adding multiple player / competition mode
- publishing / deploying ✨!
